# Coffee-Machine-Python-Hyperskill
This is "Coffee Machine (Python) Hyperskill" project form Hyperskill.<br>
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.<br>
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
